This is a Unity project of a multi-agent model that create optimized paths system among a configurable set of hotspots. Heightmap and land field generation are implemented but data are not influencing agents (work in progress).

Agent parameters can be configured and leads to different results in the global pattern. 
Virtual erosion paths system is read by agents as the current transport system and behave to recreate desire paths to get to their target.
